## Core Concept Questions

### âœ… Why is Helm important for managing configuration across different environments in a real-world product (e.g., dev, staging, prod)?

Helm allows you to template your Kubernetes manifests and inject environment-specific values using `values.yaml` files. This enables consistent application deployments with environment-specific configurations (like image tags, replica counts, domain names) without duplicating manifests.

---

### âœ… How does Helm simplify deployment rollback during a production incident?

Helm tracks release history. If a deployment fails or causes an incident, you can use `helm rollback` to revert to a previous working state with a single command, reducing downtime and operational overhead.
